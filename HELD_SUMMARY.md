# Held - Complete App Summary

## Overview

**Held** is a quiet, brand-driven, mobile-first Progressive Web App (PWA) for people who care deeply about the physical objects they own. It combines personal utility with beautiful presentation, enabling private tracking and public sharing of meaningful objects in a way that social media or spreadsheets can't match.

**Tagline**: "The quiet home for the things you hold."

## Core Features

### 1. Registry
- **Private, structured database** for a user's physical objects
- **Fields**: Title, Maker, Year, Value, Condition, Tags, Notes, Image(s)
- **Fully searchable and filterable** within the user's account
- **Secure per-user storage** in Firebase Firestore
- **Image uploads** with auto-resizing for performance
- **Private-first design** - users feel safe using it as a personal archive

### 2. Passport
- **Public, shareable identity page** for any object in the Registry
- **Optional per-object toggle** for public visibility
- **Clean permalink structure**: `/passport/[slug]`
- **Metadata-optimized** for sharing (Open Graph tags, preview images)
- **Minimalist layout** with primary image, object details, notes, and "Held by [username]"
- **Expressive sharing** - inherently visual, making them more desirable to share than spreadsheet links

### 3. Rotation
- **Curated, time-specific snapshot** of up to 7 Registry items
- **Drag-and-drop ordering** (mobile-friendly)
- **Nameable & archivable** (e.g., "Fall 2025 Setup")
- **Shareable public page**: `/rotation/[slug]` with meta previews
- **Past Rotations** viewable privately or publicly
- **Seasonal and thematic collections**
